<h2>Experiment Procedures:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Prior to beginning the experimental session, you will be asked to
  complete a background questionnaire that includes questions about your
  education, health, and demographics.</li>
  <li>The computerized experiment will involve observing images of objects,
  faces, or scenes, or listening to sounds and making judgments about them with
  key presses or mouse clicks.</li>
  <li>At the end of the session, you will be fully debriefed as to the
  rationale and hypothesis underlying this experiment.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Time Commitment:</h2>

testing session that could last for approximately 10-60 minutes. There will be
opportunities to rest during the experiment.</p>

<h2>Voluntariness/Early Withdrawal:</h2>
<p>This study is entirely voluntary. You are free
to leave the experiment at any time, and this will have no bearing on the

consequences.</p>
